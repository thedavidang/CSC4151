        Privacy Policy\n\nThis privacy policy applies to the WalletWatch© app (hereby referred to as
        "Application") for mobile devices that was created by SpendSages (hereby referred to as
        "Service Provider") as an Open Source service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".\n\n
        What information does the Application obtain and how is it used?\nThe Application does not
        obtain any information when you download and use it. Registration is not required to use the
        Application.\n\nDoes the Application collect precise real time location information of the
        device?\nThis Application does not collect precise information about the location of your
        mobile device.\n\nDo third parties see and/or have access to information obtained by the
        Application?\nSince the Application does not collect any information, no data is shared with
        third parties.\n\nWhat are my opt-out rights?\nYou can stop all collection of information by
        the Application easily by uninstalling it. You may use the standard uninstall processes as
        may be available as part of your mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or
        network.\n\nChildren\nThe Application is not used to knowingly solicit data from or market
        to children under the age of 13.\n\nThe Service Provider does not knowingly collect
        personally identifiable information from children. The Service Provider encourages all
        children to never submit any personally identifiable information through the Application
        and/or Services. The Service Provider encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their
        children\'s Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing their children
        never to provide personally identifiable information through the Application and/or Services
        without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child has provided personally
        identifiable information to the Service Provider through the Application and/or Services,
        please contact the Service Provider (stevensc3@spu.edu) so that they will be able to take
        the necessary actions. You must also be at least 16 years of age to consent to the
        processing of your personally identifiable information in your country (in some countries we
        may allow your parent or guardian to do so on your behalf).\n\nSecurity\nThe Service
        Provider is concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. However,
        since the Application does not collect any information, there is no risk of your data being
        accessed by unauthorized individuals.\n\nChanges\nThis Privacy Policy may be updated from
        time to time for any reason. The Service Provider will notify you of any changes to their
        Privacy Policy by updating this page with the new Privacy Policy. You are advised to consult
        this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all
        changes.\n\nThis privacy policy is effective as of 2024-03-17\n\nYour Consent\nBy using the
        Application, you are consenting to the processing of your information as set forth in this
        Privacy Policy now and as amended by the Service Provider.\n\nContact Us\nIf you have any
        questions regarding privacy while using the Application, or have questions about the
        practices, please contact the Service Provider via email at stevensc3@spu.edu.\n\nThis
        privacy policy page was generated by App Privacy Policy Generator
        (https://app-privacy-policy-generator.nisrulz.com/)\n\n

        Terms &amp; Conditions\nThese terms and conditions applies to the WalletWatch© app (hereby
        referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by SpendSages (hereby
        referred to as "Service Provider") as an Open Source service.\n\nUpon downloading or
        utilizing the Application, you are automatically agreeing to the following terms. It is
        strongly advised that you thoroughly read and understand these terms prior to using the
        Application. Unauthorized copying, modification of the Application, any part of the
        Application, or our trademarks is strictly prohibited. Any attempts to extract the source
        code of the Application, translate the Application into other languages, or create
        derivative versions are not permitted. All trademarks, copyrights, database rights, and
        other intellectual property rights related to the Application remain the property of the
        Service Provider.\n\nThe Service Provider is dedicated to ensuring that the Application is
        as beneficial and efficient as possible. As such, they reserve the right to modify the
        Application or charge for their services at any time and for any reason. The Service
        Provider assures you that any charges for the Application or its services will be clearly
        communicated to you.\n\nThe Application stores and processes personal data that you have
        provided to the Service Provider in order to provide the Service. It is your responsibility
        to maintain the security of your phone and access to the Application. The Service Provider
        strongly advise against jailbreaking or rooting your phone, which involves removing software
        restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. Such
        actions could expose your phone to malware, viruses, malicious programs, compromise your
        phone\'s security features, and may result in the Application not functioning correctly or at
        all.\n\nPlease note that the Application utilizes third-party services that have their own
        Terms and Conditions. Below are the links to the Terms and Conditions of the third-party
        service providers used by the Application:\n\nGoogle Play Services
        (https://policies.google.com/terms)\n\nPlease be aware that the Service Provider does not
        assume responsibility for certain aspects. Some functions of the Application require an
        active internet connection, which can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider.
        The Service Provider cannot be held responsible if the Application does not function at full
        capacity due to lack of access to Wi-Fi or if you have exhausted your data allowance.\n\nIf
        you are using the application outside of a Wi-Fi area, please be aware that your mobile
        network provider\'s agreement terms still apply. Consequently, you may incur charges from
        your mobile provider for data usage during the connection to the application, or other
        third-party charges. By using the application, you accept responsibility for any such
        charges, including roaming data charges if you use the application outside of your home
        territory (i.e., region or country) without disabling data roaming. If you are not the bill
        payer for the device on which you are using the application, they assume that you have
        obtained permission from the bill payer.\n\nSimilarly, the Service Provider cannot always
        assume responsibility for your usage of the application. For instance, it is your
        responsibility to ensure that your device remains charged. If your device runs out of
        battery and you are unable to access the Service, the Service Provider cannot be held
        responsible.\n\nIn terms of the Service Provider\'s responsibility for your use of the
        application, it is important to note that while they strive to ensure that it is updated and
        accurate at all times, they do rely on third parties to provide information to them so that
        they can make it available to you. The Service Provider accepts no liability for any loss,
        direct or indirect, that you experience as a result of relying entirely on this
        functionality of the application.\n\nThe Service Provider may wish to update the application
        at some point. The application is currently available as per the requirements for the
        operating system (and for any additional systems they decide to extend the availability of
        the application to) may change, and you will need to download the updates if you want to
        continue using the application. The Service Provider does not guarantee that it will always
        update the application so that it is relevant to you and/or compatible with the particular
        operating system version installed on your device. However, you agree to always accept
        updates to the application when offered to you. The Service Provider may also wish to cease
        providing the application and may terminate its use at any time without providing
        termination notice to you. Unless they inform you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the
        rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must cease using the
        application, and (if necessary) delete it from your device.\n\nChanges to These Terms and
        Conditions\nThe Service Provider may periodically update their Terms and Conditions.
        Therefore, you are advised to review this page regularly for any changes. The Service
        Provider will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and Conditions on this
        page.\n\nThese terms and conditions are effective as of 2024-03-17\n\nContact Us\nIf you
        have any questions or suggestions about the Terms and Conditions, please do not hesitate to
        contact the Service Provider at stevensc3@spu.edu.\n\nThis Terms and Conditions page was
